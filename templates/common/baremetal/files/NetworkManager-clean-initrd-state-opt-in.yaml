    # This file signals NetworkManager-clean-initrd-state service to run on
    # boot. This service is used to clean up the network activation state
    # generated by dracut so that other network configuration deployed by the
    # user can be activated. This only happens if dracut activated a default
    # network configuration and there is an alternate configuration available in
    # the root filesystem. Otherwise, it is assumed that the network
    # configuration activated by dracut is the one that is intended to be used
    # throughout the life of the system.
    # Opt-out for baremetal IPI deplyments, opt-in otherwise.
